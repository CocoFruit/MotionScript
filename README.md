# MotionScript
This was my High School Hack challenge chain, Esoteria. It has a fun interactable interpreter and teaches a super simple version of memory management.

# Files
- gui.py: THE FILE YOU NEED TO RUN -- this has the gui where you put in the challenge ID and what not
- pose_esti.py: the most complicated of the files. It's what does the pose estimation through media pipe and read stances
- motionScript.py: this is honestly a simple brainfuck interpreter but with a few extra add ons for ease of use
